## Introduction
The Weather App backend serves as an intermediary between the frontend and OpenWeather API, providing weather data to the app. This README explains how to set up, configure, and connect the backend to the frontend.

## Features
- Fetches weather data from OpenWeather.
- Provides API endpoints for frontend integration.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the backend, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- An OpenWeather API key. You can obtain one by signing up at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the Weather App backend:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app-backend.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-app-backend
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file with your OpenWeather API key:
   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=Your_Api_Key_Here
   ```

   This API key is essential for the backend to securely access OpenWeather data.

## Connecting to the Frontend
To connect the backend to the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the frontend repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Madhavmoudhgal/Weather-App.git
   ```

2. In your frontend project, make HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints of this backend.

3. Configure the frontend to use the backend's base URL for API requests.

That's it! Your frontend and backend are now connected, and the frontend can fetch weather data from the backend using the API endpoints provided by the backend.

## Usage
This backend automatically fetches and serves weather data to the frontend. There are no specific actions required for regular usage.

## Starting the Server
Before using the backend, you need to start the Node.js server. To do this, run the following command in the backend project directory:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start, and your backend will be up and running, ready to serve weather data to the frontend.
